      <p class="about-h">Labour and Birth Doula, Postpartum Doula, and Fertility Support Specialist</p>
      <p class="about-p">Hello! My name is Jen Atwood and I am so thrilled that you are reading this! I look forward to the opportunity to discuss your pregnancy journey with you and assist you along the way!</p>
      <p class="about-p">My interest into becoming a doula sprouted from my own journey through pregnancy. When pregnant with my daughter I experienced the ups and downs of the medical system and the lack of knowledge and personal connection that it provides. I found myself relying on Google and groups on Facebook to try to figure out answers to my questions. When it came to the physical birth of my daughter I walked into the hospital with a solid plan and thoughts of how I wanted it to go and constantly had the doctors and nurses trying to push me towards alternative plans. I remember being my own guide through my pregnancy and wishing that I had someone who was there with me, aside from my husband, who was an amazing helping hand. It was quite hard and scary being my own advocate at the hospital and not faltering on the path that I had chosen.</p>
      <p class="about-p">I experienced the same thing that many women go through and as soon as I had pushed out my little bundle of joy, I was given warnings not to shake her, I was briefly shown how to swaddle her, then I was pushed out the hospital door and our little family was left to figure the rest out ourselves. The first couple weeks was a whirlwind, trying to learn the ins and outs of breastfeeding while balancing naps and self care. I truly didnâ€™t know the meaning of sleep or self care in those first moments. It was hard. And again, Google and Facebook were my main sources of information.</p>
      <p class="about-p">I realized at this time that I wanted to help other women not experience their journey in the same way that I did. I wanted to provide women with the information that their doctors or midwives might not provide them, and I wanted to be there with them along their whole journey, including the very important and stressful postpartum moments.</p>
      <p class="about-p">I am very passionate about knowledge and sharing what I know. I am judgement free and want to help you have the experience you want. From the moment you conceive until the moment you and your partner (or just yourself) are comfortable with the postpartum period, I would love to be there for you to lean on.</p>
      <p class="about-p">I look forward to finding out what makes you tick and what your hopes and dreams are for your pregnancy! You are a rockstar and you are going to be so amazing with your birth journey whether we work together or not!</p>
